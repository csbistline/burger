## About
* In this assignment, you'll create a burger logger with MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and a homemade ORM (yum!). Be sure to follow the MVC design pattern; use Node and MySQL to query and route data in your app, and Handlebars to generate your HTML.

## Installation
* Clone the repository: https://github.com/csbistline/burger.git
* Run `npm install`
* Live demo: https://ancient-crag-70365.herokuapp.com/

## How-to use this application
* Tasty Burger! is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat. Whenever a user submits a burger's name, your app will display the burger on the left side of the page -- waiting to be devoured. Each burger in the waiting area also has a `NOM NOM NOM` button. When the user clicks it, the burger will move to the right side of the page. It can be put back on the menu by clicking the `ORDER ANOTHER` button.
